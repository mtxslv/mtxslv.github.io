In the previous two posts ([Node Class](https://mtxslv.github.io/id3_part_1/) and [Math Functions](https://mtxslv.github.io/id3_part_2/)) I explained the goal of the project and some concepts needed to make it work. Now it is time to finish this series introducing the Tree Class and how it will do the job of classifying instances.

It is important to notice there are more than just one algorithm for creating Decision Trees. As explained in the first post, I will focus on the _Iterative Dichotommiser 3_ algorithm (ID3).

# The Algorithm

The [Mini Project](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse446/15sp/assignments/1/hw1.pdf) asks to generalize the ID3 algorithm (using split-stopping, though I did not implement it). Such algorithm can be seen below.

# Final Discussion

When I applied the algorithm to the project test dataset, I got ~27% of accuracy (that's pretty low, sadly). 

There's a bug, also. In the instance ```[  ]```, the bug says the value 6 is not in a list
