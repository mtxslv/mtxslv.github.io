Looking for references is not something easy... I know how is to look for books, papers and videos about a particular subject and do not find anything good enough. And worse, sometimes we may find, but it is not clear enough, direct enough, simple/dense enough, and so on.

So I'd like to share my particular bibliography. It is a collection of books (links and videos may appear, who knows?) that I used and found clear _for me_. Maybe it will fit your needs (what I hope), or maybe not: so don't feel worry if need to research a little more.

# Probability

Definitely I would recommend 

# Calculus

# Linear Algebra
