[OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) is a library with programming functions aimed for Computer Vision applications. t is a very important tool and one way to begin working with it is trying to develop simple examples.

In this example let's try to solve [this one](https://agostinhobritojr.github.io/tutorial/pdi/#_exerc%C3%ADcios). Agostinho Brito Jr is a professor of Digital Image Processing at Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte. You can find more about his work in [his personal github page](agostinhobritojr.github.io).

Ok, no more talking. Hands on!
