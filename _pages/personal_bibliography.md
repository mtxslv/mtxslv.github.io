Looking for references is not something easy... I know how is to look for books, papers and videos about a particular subject and do not find anything good enough. And worse, sometimes we may find, but it is not clear enough, direct enough, simple/dense enough, and so on.

So I'd like to share my particular bibliography. It is a collection of books (links and videos may appear, who knows?) that I used and found clear _for me_. Maybe it will fit your needs (what I hope), or maybe not: so don't feel worry if need to research a little more.

# Probability & Statistics

 I would recommend [Statistics: Principle and Methods](https://books.google.com.br/books/about/Statistics.html?id=6MkfAQAAIAAJ&redir_esc=y), written by Richard A. Johnson and Gouri K. Bhattacharyya. I didn't use it during my probability and statistics course, but when I needed to review the concepts, it served me well.

# Calculus

Still to come ;)

# Linear Algebra

Still to come ;)
