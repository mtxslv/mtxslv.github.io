Hey there! How are you all? Hope you're healthy. 
At the moment of this post I am studying Digital Image Processing, under the tutelage of [Agostinho Brito Jr](https://agostinhobritojr.github.io/). You can check out his online Digital Image Processing Classes by clicking [on this link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWWAoQUirHNruwCBxOgBhHKXdf7et_rAO).

# The Task 
I'll address the following task troughout this post:

> [The histogram of an image is a function that maps each gray level of an image to the number of times it occurs in the image](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/image-histogram). [They are particularly useful to improve greyscale images with the greyscale intensities crowded in any end](https://youtu.be/bizozBThvyA?t=2083), through a process called _histogram equalization_. Throughout this post, I will introduce a code that applies histogram equalization on images captured from a laptop camera and show an example of the process capabilities. 
> As it is detailed in [Agostinho's blog post about the task](https://agostinhobritojr.github.io/tutorial/pdi/#_exerc%C3%ADcios_3), the code must equalize a greyscale image, not the colorized version. 

During the code explanation I will not highlight code comments. If you want to have access to the complete code, please check out [my code on Github](https://github.com/mtxslv/dca0445_dip/blob/master/exercises/labeling_improved.cpp).

# Code

{% raw %}
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <opencv2/opencv.hpp>

int main(int argc, char** argv){
  cv::Mat image, greyscale_image, equalized_greyscale_image;
  int width, height;
  cv::VideoCapture cap;
  int key;
```
{% endraw %}

The code begins with the proper imports: ```iostream``` and ```opencv```. The first one deals with the input/output stream, while the last one is the default computer vision library.

The ```main``` function begins with the definition of the variables:
* ```image``` will contain the image to be processed. Since I need to work with a greyscale image, let's define a good variable for it: ```greyscale_image```. Let's define another ```Mat``` object that will receive the equalized greyscale image (```equalized_greyscale_image```); 
* ```width``` and ```height``` will contain ```image``` shape;
* ```cap```: [Class for video capturing from video files, image sequences or cameras](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d8/dfe/classcv_1_1VideoCapture.html#details) (webcam, uh?);
* The ```key``` object will contain the _keycode_ values for any key pressed during running.

The image is read from the command line (remember: we will run the code in linux terminal). We check if it was properly read. If it was not, we finish the program. If so, we display the image dimensions.

{% raw %}
```cpp

	cap.open(0);
  
  if(!cap.isOpened()){
    std::cout << "cameras indisponiveis";
    return -1;
  }
  
  cap.set(cv::CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH, 640);
  cap.set(cv::CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT, 480);  
  width = cap.get(cv::CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH);
  height = cap.get(cv::CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT);

  std::cout << "largura = " << width << std::endl;
  std::cout << "altura  = " << height << std::endl;
```
{% endraw %}

The conection to the video capture device is opened (the 0 parameter indicates I want to open the first camera available). Then [it's checked out if the connection has been properly initialized](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d8/dfe/classcv_1_1VideoCapture.html#a9d2ca36789e7fcfe7a7be3b328038585).

Using ```cap.set()``` method I define the captured frame shape. It is arbitrary set to $$ (width,height) = (480,640) $$. Such shape is read, saved using ```width``` and ```height``` and displayed on the terminal.

{% raw %}
```cpp
  while(1){
    cap >> image;
    cv::cvtColor(image,greyscale_image,6); //turn image to grey

    // equalizing histograms:
    cv::equalizeHist(greyscale_image,equalized_greyscale_image);

    //cv::namedWindow("image");
    cv::imshow("image", image);
    //cv::namedWindow("greyscale image");    
    cv::imshow("greyscale image",greyscale_image);
    cv::imshow("equalized greyscale image",equalized_greyscale_image);
    key = cv::waitKey(30);
    if(key == 27) break;
    if(key == 32){
      //salvar imagens
      cv::imwrite("./exercises_images/greyscale_image.png",greyscale_image);
      cv::imwrite("./exercises_images/equalized_greyscale_image.png",equalized_greyscale_image);
      std::cout<<"imagens salvas!"<<std::endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}  
```
{% endraw %}

The previous loop forms the spine of the code. It continually processes the frames (```image```) acquired by the ```cap``` object.

The first thing to do is to convert the frames to _greyscale_ using ```cv::cvtColor()```. The parameter _6_ is [a code to indicate I want to convert from _BGR_ to _Gray_](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d8/d01/group__imgproc__color__conversions.html#gga4e0972be5de079fed4e3a10e24ef5ef0a353a4b8db9040165db4dacb5bcefb6ea). 

When ```cv::equalizeHist``` is applied, the original image is mapped onto the equalized one. This equalized one will have better constrast, because [its histogram will be more strechted](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d4/d1b/tutorial_histogram_equalization.html).

The code ends reading any key pressed. If _esc_ is pressed, the program stops running. If _spacebar_ is pressed, the program saves the images.

# Example

Let's run the code on the terminal:
{% end %}
```shell
$ ./exercises/equalize
```
{% endraw %}

And here we can the result (the first one is the original greyscale image and the last one is the equalized greyscale one):
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/posts_images/2020-10-18-equalize/greyscale_image.png" alt="">
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/posts_images/2020-10-18-equalize/equalized_greyscale_image.png" alt="">

Notice how dark the original image is. We barely can see the name in front of the book (_National Geographic_), my face or the photography on the book cover.

After the histogram equalization, the words become more readable. We can see the rectangular logo of the famous magazine at the top of the book. We can see a face on the book also: the famous picture of Sharbat Gula taken by photojournalist Steve McCurry.

> My ghostly face can be seen better in the equalized image. I hope it does not haunt anyone XD.
